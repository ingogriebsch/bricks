Bricks is a framework that allows you to create automated documentation about an application and its components. 
The framework is easy to integrate and offers maximum flexibility to document any type of application.

Frameworks like [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/), [CodeScene](https://empear.com/) or [Arc42](https://arc42.de/) are very powerful, but cost money and / or require a lot of training. 
That's why we wanted to create an easy to use alternative that is flexible and easy to customize and expand.

Our primary goals are:

*   Build documentation based on conventions and largely generated information.
*   Storage of the generated documentation together with the component itself.
*   An easy to extend framework to document different types of applications (monolithic, microservice based).
*   Make available a visualization of the collected information in the form of a dashboard and documents that can be reused offline.
